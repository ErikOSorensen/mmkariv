We test the touchstones of economic rationality---utility maximization,
stochastic dominance, and expected-utility maximization---of elite students
in the U.S. and in Africa. The choices of most students in both samples are
generally rationalizable, but the U.S. students' scores are substantially
higher. Nevertheless, the development gap in economic rationality between
these future elites is much smaller than the difference in performance on a
canonical cognitive ability test, often used as a proxy for economic
decision-making ability in studies of economic development and growth. We
argue for the importance of including consistency with economic rationality
in studies of decision-making ability.
