**Abstract**: We test the touchstones of economic rationality---utility
maximization, stochastic dominance, and expected-utility maximization---of elite
students in the U.S. and in Africa. The choices of most students in both samples
are generally rationalizable, but the U.S. students' scores are substantially
higher. Nevertheless, the development gap in economic rationality between these
future elites is much smaller than the difference in performance on a canonical
cognitive ability test, often used as a proxy for economic decision-making
ability in studies of economic development and growth. We argue for the
importance of including consistency with economic rationality in studies of
decision-making ability.


## Overview

The master file this replication package will:

1. Install the required versions of the necessary `R` packages from CRAN.
2. Downloads the necessary datafiles from Harvard Dataverse (TBC).
3. Create all the displays in the paper as separate files (documented below).
4. Create markdown documents for numbers referenced in the paper but not explicitly part of produced tables.

## Computational requirements

### Software requirements

### Memory and runtime requirements

Approximate time needed to reproduce all the analyses on a desktop machine (2023) 
would be about 15 seconds.


## Description of programs/code

The graphical displays are produced in the `graphs/` directory (as pdf-files). The tables are
produced in the `tables/` directory (as tex-files).
